# mpdirectory
A directory server for multiplayer games originally based on the Dark Places directory server.

All credit to those original authors.

The original readme is preserved as readme-original.txt

mpdirectory mainly exists to serve as a directory server for the ioquake3 project.
However, we are happy to add support for additional games as is possible.

Already, mpdirectory supports Quake III: Arena, Team Arena, mods, and additional games based
on the original Quake 3 source code such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein: 
Enemy Territory.

The main ioquake3 directory server is located at directory.ioquake3.org
